\#Lab M1.03 - sklearn Model Training + Evaluation

\## Marco Martins



This repository contains two machine learning projects completed as part of the Ironhack lab exercises. Each project is organized in its own folder with notebooks, visualizations, and supporting files.

\## Part 1 – Breast Cancer Prediction



\*\*Folder:\*\* `pt1`



\*\*Description:\*\*  

In this project, we built a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict breast cancer diagnosis (malignant or benign) based on patient data.



\*\*Contents:\*\*

\- `breast\_cancer\_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with complete code, exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.

\- `knn\_k\_comparison1-11.png` – Visualization comparing KNN performance metrics for K values from 1 to 11.

\- `knn\_k\_comparison1-21.png` – Visualization comparing KNN performance metrics for K values from 1 to 21.



\*\*Highlights:\*\*

\- Explored dataset and handled missing values.

\- Tested multiple K values to select the optimal K.

\- Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

\- Visualizations illustrate model performance for different K values.

\## Part 2 – Customer Churn Prediction



\*\*Folder:\*\* `pt2`



\*\*Description:\*\*  

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify customers likely to leave the service.



\*\*Contents:\*\*

\- `churn\_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with complete code, including data exploration, preprocessing, KNN model training, evaluation, K experimentation, and detailed analysis in markdown cells.

\- `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` – Original dataset used for the analysis.

\- `REPORT\_CustomerChurnPredictionProject.txt` – A brief project report summarizing the approach, model performance, key insights, business recommendations, and limitations.



\*\*Highlights:\*\*

\- Checked and handled missing data, converted categorical features to numeric, and separated features and target.

\- Addressed imbalanced classes by evaluating precision and recall.

\- Experimented with multiple K values to find the best model according to business priorities.

\- Detailed markdown explanations help understand the data, modeling decisions, and results.
