I don't know. I bet those men are going to get quite a reception when they get back. Oh yes, I'll be so glad.

[20.0s - 40.0s]: I think that's pretty well fact, because they've landed so many safely now that I feel relieved. Just getting off of the moon was the thing that was... Have they met with the one that was circling the moon? Yes, they've round the moon.
