# Week 1 – Lab 1: HomeGuard Security System
This lab implements a simple home security system simulator using Python.

## Author: Marco Martins

## Contents
- `homeguard\_system.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation
- `simulation\_output.txt` – Sample output from running the simulation
- `Screenshots/` – Screenshots showing the program running and alerts triggered
- `README.md` – Lab description and structure

## Description
The HomeGuard system simulates different types of sensors:
- Motion sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Door sensor
- Smoke sensor
The system runs in different modes (`HOME`, `AWAY`, `SLEEP`) and generates alerts based on sensor readings and system mode.
Sensor values are randomly generated to simulate real-world behavior.

## How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells:
(run\_simulation(duration\_minutes=3, system\_mode="AWAY")

You can change the system mode to test different scenarios:
- HOME
- AWAY
- SLEEP
