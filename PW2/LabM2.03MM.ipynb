    "# Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is the main advantage of using functions instead of writing the same code multiple times?\n",
    "The main advantage of using functions is **code reusability**. A function lets us write logic once and reuse it many times with different inputs. This makes the code shorter and easier to maintain. If something needs to change, I only need update the function instead of fixing the same code in several places.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. In Exercise 1, why did we use a default parameter value for `language`?\n",
    "We used a default parameter value so the function could work even when the user does not provide a language. This makes the function more flexible and easier to use, because the caller only needs to pass the required information (the name), and it avoids errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. In Exercise 2, why is it important to check the conditions in order from highest to lowest (90, then 80, then 70, etc.)?\n",
    "In this case conditions are evaluated from top to bottom. When checking from highest to lowest, each grade range is clearly separated and higher scores are matched first, which avoids incorrect classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to check from lowest to highest, but in that case the conditions must be written differently (for example, using upper bounds like `percentage < 60`, `percentage < 70`, etc.). **See example below** The **key point** is that the order and the comparison logic must be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. How did the pseudocode help you in Exercise 2? What would have been different if you had to write it from scratch?\n",
    "The pseudocode was almost the code we needed to do. However, it was like a roadmap for the logic of the program. It made the problem easier to understand by focusing on *what* the program should do before worrying about Python syntax. Without pseudocode, I would need to think more about the logic before doing the code.\n"
